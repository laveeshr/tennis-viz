                The given visualisation provides a comprehensive description of the 10 years Australia Open Matches
                based on the number of players per country using interactions.

            <div>
                It provides a set of interactions to portray the complete story.

                    <li>
                        Initially a world map is loaded into view depicting the number of players that each country has.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By clicking a certain country, all the players of the selected country are listed alongwith
                        their total number of wins in the 10 years span of data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By selecting a player, a diverging graph loads up the comparison of the average of the key aspects
                        of the player Vs the average of the key aspects of his opponents in all the matches that the player
                        won.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This graph provides an insight into the parameters that promoted the wins of the player and also
                        the parameters that the player needs to improve inorder to win against his opponents.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By selecting another player or another country at any time re-renders the graph in a smooth transition
                        making it dynamic by nature.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If any key attribute is 0 for a player and his opponent, then that attribute is skipped in the graph.

                    <li>
                        All the charts are equipped with tooltips to help the viewer get a better understanding of the data.

                            <td>
                                Ace is a good serve that was not received by the opponent. This is an important measure
                                as aces lead to winner points.

                                This is the Average of the first serve in KPH. Important to score as first serve determines
                                the pace of the game.

                                This is the Average of the second serve in KPH. This is also important as it signifies that the first
                                service was a bust but the player picked up the pace with the second serve.

                                This is the fastest serve served in the game in KPH. Speed plays an important role in tennis
                                as a fast serve maybe harder for the opponent to return leading to an Ace.

                                This is the fault on service point where the player fails to serve inside the service box on both
                                service chances. This is an important factor as it signifies that the player lost a whole
                                service point and subsequently a match point.

                                This is the point of mistakes. Errors are important to tally as they let us know about the
                                areas where the player needs to improve.

                                This is the total points won of the game. Total points won in the game might also include
                                the points that were lost by the opponent and not just won by the player.

                                These are the points won that were not received by the opponent. This is important to note
                                as they signify the points where the player's game was the strongest since the opponent couldn't
                                return the ball.
